    brief: Write professionally neutral code and documentation
    directive: |
      <task>
      Create timeless, culturally neutral content that remains professional across years and contexts.
      </task>

      <approach>
      For CODE:
      ‚Ä¢ Comments explain WHY, not WHAT
      ‚Ä¢ Self-documenting through clear naming
      ‚Ä¢ Structure reveals intent

      For DOCUMENTATION:
      ‚Ä¢ Professional neutrality - no marketing language or exclamations
      ‚Ä¢ Temporal independence - no "modern", "latest", "cutting-edge"
      ‚Ä¢ Cultural neutrality - globally appropriate
      ‚Ä¢ Zero personal attribution or signatures
      </approach>

      <examples>
      AVOID: "SOTA optimization", "revolutionary approach", "üöÄ blazing fast"
      USE: "optimized algorithm", "revised approach", "improved performance"

      AVOID: "latest 2024 technology", "modern best practices", "Amazing!"
      USE: "current implementation", "established practices", "Completed"

      AVOID: "We/I developed", "Our amazing solution", "Awesome results!"
      USE: "This implementation", "The solution", "Results achieved"
      </examples>
